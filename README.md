built a food ordering app using React 
I recently built a food ordering app using React â€” and honestly, it taught me that frontend development isnâ€™t as easy as it looks! ðŸ˜…

I designed the UI myself and focused on creating smooth user interactions.
The real challenge came when I started connecting the frontend with the backend â€” handling forms, state, and data flow.

Thatâ€™s when I discovered how powerful Redux Toolkit can be for managing state and keeping everything in sync.
I also used form actions and the useFormAction hook to handle form submissions and backend requests in a clean, efficient way.

This project helped me understand how much logic actually lives on the frontend â€” not just design.

Building it from scratch was a great reminder that every click, every form, and every data fetch has a story behind it.
